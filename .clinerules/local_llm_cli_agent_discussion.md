# Local LLM CLI Agent Discussion Summary

## Goal
Develop a **local LLM-based CLI agent** capable of:
- Receiving **natural language commands**.
- Generating **almost complete code in one shot** (around 90% complete).
- Allowing the user to refine remaining issues via **VSCode QuickFix**.
- Eventually enabling **self-optimization** through Rust/Mojo code generation and distillation.

## Model Considerations

### Primary Models for Natural Language → Code
| Model | Size | Strengths | Trade-offs |
|-------|------|-----------|------------|
| **Phi-1.5** | 1.3B | Excellent instruction-following and reasoning; strong for Rust/Mojo code generation | Slightly larger than 1B, but more efficient than TinyLLaMA 1.1B |
| **Qwen1.5-0.5B** | 0.5B | Lightweight, instruction-following, faster CPU inference | Code generation less accurate than Phi |
| StarCoder-mini / SantaCoder | 1.1B | Strong code completion | Weaker natural language → full code generation; better for incremental tasks |
| CodeGen2 | 1B | General code generation from English | Older model, moderate accuracy |

### Strategy
- **Phi-1.5**: main candidate for high-accuracy one-shot generation.
- **Qwen0.5B**: secondary candidate for low-latency CPU execution.
- StarCoder-mini: optional for incremental completion tasks.

## CPU & Inference Optimizations
- Use **quantization (4-bit AWQ / INT4)** and **threading optimization** for CPU-only inference.
- KV cache quantization and efficient memory usage are important for local performance.
- Distillation can reduce model size for better CPU deployment.

## Self-Optimization & Distillation

### Workflow
1. User issues command in CLI (natural language).
2. LLM outputs near-complete code (90%).
3. User applies fixes in VSCode (quick fix).
4. CLI captures corrections for **real-time lightweight distillation**:
   - **LoRA/adapter update** for immediate improvement.
   - **Cache previous mistakes** to avoid repeated errors.
5. Background asynchronous full distillation updates the main model periodically.

### Design Considerations
- **Immediate improvement is more important than latency**, acceptable response time: 10–30 seconds per command.
- Lightweight LoRA updates + cache prevent repeated mistakes without blocking CLI responsiveness.
- Full model distillation can run asynchronously in the background.

---

## Future Vision
- Rust/Mojo specialization: LLM gradually learns the user’s coding patterns.
- CLI acts as **personalized, self-optimizing LLM agent**.
- Over time, small model + continual distillation leads to a **highly optimized local code assistant**.

---

## Notes
- Focus on **small but high-quality models**: 1B or smaller for CPU feasibility.
- Separate **real-time incremental learning** from **heavy offline distillation**.
- Use **online LoRA updates** for immediate error correction.
- Optional: integrate embeddings for previously corrected patterns for even faster improvement.
